Q) Write a program to find the element in a array. Time complexity for this program is O(n).

Algorithm

1. We will initialise an array of n elements and take an element to be searched such as x.
2. Then will will check for each element in an array and check whether it is x or not.
3. If yes then we will print the index, or will print not found.
